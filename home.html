                 <h1>Continients</h1>
                <br>
                On a globe, continents are the easiest things to spot. A continent is a large solid area of land. 
                Earth has seven continents. In order from largest to smallest, they are Asia, Africa, North America
                , South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Sometimes people think of Europe and Asia as a
                 single continent called Eurasia. Australia is part of a larger area called Oceania or Australasia.
                  It includes many islands in the Pacific Ocean.
        ​
                The continents have different kinds of weather, landscapes, and populations. For 
                instance, Antarctica is icy and has very little plant and animal life. Africa, though, 
                tends to be very warm and has a great variety of plants and animals.
                
                Most of the continents are also divided into political units called countries. 
                Parts of Antarctica are claimed by several countries, but there are no permanent settlements
                 on the continent. Australia is the only continent that is occupied by a single country.
                
                In 1912 a German scientist named Alfred Wegener came up with the idea that the 
                continents were once all joined together. He called this large body of land Pangaea.
                 He suggested that more than 200 million years ago Pangaea split apart to form the continents. The
                  continents then drifted apart to their current locations.
                
                Scientists since then have found evidence that this idea is correct. They now 
                believe that the continents sit on a number of large plates. The plates float on a layer of
                 melted rock. As the plates slide over the melted rock, the continents also move. This idea is 
                 called plate tectonics.</p>

                <h2>Australia</h2>
        ​
                <p>The world's smallest continent, southeast of Asia between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. ... 
                    The definition of Australia is the name of one of the seven continents of the world and includes
                     the countries of Australia, New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and the Raja Ampat Islands.</p>
