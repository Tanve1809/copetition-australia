              <h2>Here is a story for you!!</h2>
        ​
              <p id="para-text-story">Once   upon a time the seven continents had a meeting. Asia, the eldest was the head of the meeting. Asia said, welcome all continents!!! In this meeting we will be discussing our various jobs for the year. Tomorrow is new year!! I hope all the continents are here……As I am the head of the meeting, I will tell my job first. I carry a lot of countries like India, china, Pakistan etc. I also carry some of the richest people in the world!! I am the biggest continent. I am home to the highest mountains!!
        ​
                then, north America said , “There are 23 countries in me!! and 9 dependencies with a total of more than 590 million people living on the continent.
                 My largest Country: Canada. ...
                 My largest City: Mexico City, which is the capital city of Mexico with a population of about 9 million. 
                 
                
                and the other continients told their jobs too…
                
                then came the turn of the smallest continent. Everybody laughed at him. He grew angry and said “you cannot manage without me. I am very important too”.
                
                everybody laughed again and said “we cannot manage without you!!! Hahahahah!!! You are so funny!!! Of course we can manage without you”
                
                and so after the other continents said this Australia marched out of the room…..He said wait and see and went off. After new year, many people started searching for Australia. Because of the other continets Australia had gone!! Many jobs and rare animals went missing!! The gods saw this and asked the other continents. They told what had happened and laughed!! God zeus got angry and told them about the people who were suffering….the continents were very surprised and asked Australia to come back and they realised everybody is important in the world.
